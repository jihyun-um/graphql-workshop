This project consists of the exercises I've completed during the workshop. The GraphQL exercises are in [/graphql-server](https://github.com/jihyun-um/graphql-workshop/tree/master/graphql-server) and the React exercises are in [/react-app](https://github.com/jihyun-um/graphql-workshop/tree/master/react-app).
