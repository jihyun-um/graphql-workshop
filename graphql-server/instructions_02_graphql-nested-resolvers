[Step 1]
Modifying the schema
Add an articles property for the User type which should return an array of articles.

Modifying the resolvers
In your resolvers object add a User field, and on it add an articles field.
The articles field should return all the articles by that particular user
In order to access the current user, use the first argument of the resolver (parent)
Because the parent will represent a user, the id of that user is parent.id


[Step 2]
Modifying the schema
Add an author property for the Article type which should return a User type (the author of that article)

Modifying the resolvers
In your resolvers object add a Article field, and on it add an author field.
The author field should return the author of the article, which is a User object
Just search the users array for the user that has the id of parent.authorId
